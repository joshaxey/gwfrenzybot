===========

Incredibly obsoleted, incredibly simple bot script that was designed for "death-levelling" perma-pre characters in the grand old days of Guild Wars perma-pre characters, <hipster> before it was cool </hipster>.

I doubt anyone will ever use this again, but it does still work if you're stuck with your rose tinted goggles.
